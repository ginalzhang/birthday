        <h2>happy bday baefy :3</h2>
        <p>it took a rly long time to <code>code</code> this. i hope u find it a bit silly, creative, and fun. i hope u've had an amazing bday so far. i feel rly sad that i can't do much for u on days like this :(.
            thank u for being so forgiving and patient, it feels so genuine when u reassure me that
            i don't have to get u anything on special days. i've been so busy recently w apps + studying, but i've been trying
           my best to at least push out smt small for u even if u say it's not necessary. (it's the least u deserve!) </p>

        <p>on another note, congratulations! u have made it thru another year. time passes by so fast. pictures of u from a few years ago seem so faraway now.
            i can see how time has sculpted u, whether it be through ur emotions or face. i feel rly selfish when i look at how kind u are to listen to me and allow me 
            to be emotional, even if i am eighteen, and not "young enough" to cry anymore. ur generousity is etched in the lines around ur eyes from staying up late to offer me solace
            or to help ur parents, and ur humoungous heart gives me a place to allow myself to cry. the growth from ur character and features have proved that u have sowed each year 
            significantly, in ways beneficial to u.

        <p>during nights or days, when i ask the same questions, u always have the same answers.</p>
        <p><i>"yes, baby. i love you and you're gorgeous."</i></p>
        <p>i know it might seem trivial, and it might be repetitive, but it means the world to me. maybe routinely things like good morning and goodnight messages seem mundane,
            but they add to the everyday bits of love that one may take for granted.

      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p> when u wld answer quickly to my tiresome questions, like yesterday during our val games, i knew i cld feel comfy w u. usually, 
            ppl get irritated at the same question being asked over and over again, but u take it like a champ. 
            <p><i>"yup, that's my part time job. answering my gf's silly questions even if she asked the same one x1000 already."</i></p>
             it makes me rly soft to know that i'm treated wonderfully by u. time and time again, no matter how
            many years go by, it seems like i'll always be lucky to have u by my side, no matter how unchanging it gets. </p>

        <p>this feels more like an anniversary letter than a bday letter haha. i don't know how to write a letter without sounding romantic, especially when it comes to you.
            even if there are some things that won't change w u, hopefully i can write a bday letter that doesn't sound like a valentine's letter w time. i hope u'll stay around
            to witness it happening. geez, my complaining abt my inadequate writing skills is taking an entire page up. thank u for allowing me to take up space once again.

        <p>for a long time in my life, i didn't think it was ok to be so open w someone. but to see u be so enthusiastic abt smt that society outcasts me for (<i>farts</i>),
             7 year old me feels happy to know her future best friend would love to be able to whiff the tendrils of the scent in his nostrils.to go back on the subject of time, i wonder how we'll turn out to be in a couple of years. will we be okay? how will we survive another year? 
            will it be easier now that weâ€™re older or will it be harder because of all the work and responsibilities that come with age? </p>

        <p> these questions
            make me feel aggravated at times, but i know that even if each grain of sand trickles from the hourglass, it will be okay. with ur perseverance,
             i could never lose faith in this religion that i call love. and even if i might doubt myself a little, u always are there to make sure that nothing is wrong.
              with every little nag that i hear (close the door and turn off ur lights) (be sure to finish studying before u call me again), i know that love exists. 
              because you are there, every time i need u. even if time weathers us into different people, i hope the love that we hold for each other remains static. here's to
              another year (and many more happy birthdays) with u.

        <p>thank u for making it this far baby :). to reward u for ur very hard work, here is a 
        <a href="surprise.html">surprise</a>! (click the surprise blue word for it) i know u said u wanted a bunch of skins in the item shop, so perhaps this should
    suffice u for the time being until the rest of the gifts arrive to u. <br><br>sincerely,<br>ur silly boogalicious baefy 3000<br><br>
p.s. look at u aren't u so perfect!! ur soooooo handsome my lover. may we grow old and look at these pictures of us tgt like this :3 <3</p>
